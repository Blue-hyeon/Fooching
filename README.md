1:1 none face-to-face pt trainer matching platform
People's interest in sports is very high. To diet or to build a body like this, I mainly do gym or home training. In the case of fitness, it is difficult for beginners to enter, and above all, the cost of PT is not high. I decided to create a platform for people who wanted to get into health but were having trouble starting and struggling with the cost.

# Who use
The target audience of our application is divided into two categories: PT trainers and fitness beginners. 

# Project is useful
It is a platform that matches these two, and beginners in health can get feedback on necessary information such as exercise and diet from the matched PT trainer, and the PT trainer provides feedback to users with less effort than members who do face-to-face.
